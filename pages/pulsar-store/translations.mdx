# Translations

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
	We are no longer accepting new translations for the addon due to the release of [Pulsar Store 2](/pulsar-store-2/getting-started)
</Callout>

### If you want to translate the addon into your own language, you can use the file supplied below
Please only translate this if you can actually speak the language... I am not going to add translations to the addon if you stick it in Google translate and send me it.
Once you have translated the addon you can send me a message on GmodStore or through Discord: @lythium4848
