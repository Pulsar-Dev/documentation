# Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to install three things into your `garrysmod/addons` folder.
1. PulsarStore
2. PIXEL UI
3. gm_express

The folder structure should look like this:
<FileTree>
	<FileTree.Folder name="garrysmod" defaultOpen>
		<FileTree.Folder name="addons" defaultOpen>
			<FileTree.Folder name="pixel-ui" defaultOpen>
				<FileTree.Folder name="..." defaultOpen>
				</FileTree.Folder>
				<FileTree.File name="README.md" />
			</FileTree.Folder>
			<FileTree.Folder name="pulsar-store" defaultOpen>
				<FileTree.Folder name="..." defaultOpen>
				</FileTree.Folder>
				<FileTree.File name="README.md" />
			</FileTree.Folder>
			<FileTree.Folder name="gm_express" defaultOpen>
				<FileTree.Folder name="..." defaultOpen>
				</FileTree.Folder>
				<FileTree.File name="README.md" />
			</FileTree.Folder>
		</FileTree.Folder>
	</FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

	The addon folder name must not contain capital letters on **Linux** servers and will fail to load if it does.

## PIXEL UI
<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
	Please note that PulsarStore **REQUIRES** the PulsarDevelopment fork of PIXEL UI as it contains special features for PulsarStore that are not in the main version.
</Callout>

2. Extract the contents of the zip file into your `garrysmod/addons` folder.

## [gm_express](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express)
gm_express is **REQUIRED** for PulsarStore to work.<br/>

### What is [gm_express](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express) and why is it used?
[**gm_express**](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express) is a library
that allows you to send lots of data over the network without having to worry about the size limit.
This means that we can send large amounts of your PulsarStore data even if you have thousands of items in a couple of seconds.<br/>
[**gm_express**](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express) uses the HTTP library to achieve this,
meaning that the data has to be sent to an HTTP server.
No private, personal or sensitive data is ever sent to the HTTP server, only public data that is required for PulsarStore to work.<br/>
If you **do not** want to use gm_express' own web server kindly provided free of charge by [**CFC-Servers**](https://github.com/CFC-Servers) you can either [use your own](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express_service) or use the PulsarDevelopment teams' web server.<br/>
If you need assistance or have any questions regarding gm_express, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2ZQv7dVmtJ) and ask.

### Installing gm_express
1. Download the latest version of gm_express from [here](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Extract the contents of the zip file into your `garrysmod/addons` folder.
3. Ensure the addon name does not contain capital letters.
