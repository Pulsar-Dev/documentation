# Migrating from BricksCreditStore to Pulsar v3.x

## Introduction
This document describes the steps to import your data from BricksCreditStore to v3.x.
Importing your data is a quick and easy process.

1. Do NOT delete your <span class="text-yellow-400 dark:text-yellow-400">BricksCreditStore</span> data. If you do it will be unrecoverable.
2. Enable the <span class="text-yellow-400 dark:text-yellow-400">BricksCreditStore</span>  to <span class="text-rose-500 dark:text-rose-500">PulsarStore v3.x</span> importing tool by changing `Config.Enabled` to `true` in the importer config. This can be found in `pulsarstore/lua/pulsar_store/config/importers/sv_bricks_sqlite.lua`
4. Run the console command `pulsarstore_import BricksCreditStore SQLite` to start the import process. This may take a while depending on the size of your data.
5. Once the import is complete, you can disable the importer by changing `Config.Enabled` to `false` in the importer config.
6. Restarting your server is recommended but not required.
