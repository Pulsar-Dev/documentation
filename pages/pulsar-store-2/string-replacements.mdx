# String Replacements
In some actions you can use string replacements. These are special strings that will be replaced with a value when the action is executed. The following string replacements are available:
 - `{sid}` - The players SteamID
 - `{sid64}` - The players SteamID64
 - `{name}` - The players name
 - `{nickname}` - The players nickname

If you need more string replacements please create a ticket on gmodstore.
