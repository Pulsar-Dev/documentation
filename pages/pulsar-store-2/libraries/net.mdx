# Net Library
The Net library is very similar to the base gmod net library except it has a few more features.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
	On the client there is a feature called the **Network Queue**. This is a queue of net messages that get sent to the server in order.<br/>
	This is useful for when you want to send a lot of net messages but need a way of going around the rate limit.<br/>
	The network queue **CANNOT** be bypassed or disabled.
</Callout>

## Global Server Methods

## Global Client Methods
<MethodList methods={[
	{
		name: "Receive",
		parent: "PulsarStore.Net.",
		description: "Receives a net message from the server.",
		args: ["name, function, allowedGroups"],
		returns: [""],
	},
	{
		name: "Start",
		parent: "PulsarStore.Net.",
		description: "Starts a net message",
		args: ["name"],
		returns: [""],
	},
	{
		name: "Send",
		parent: "PulsarStore.Net.",
		description: "Sends a net message to a server",
		args: ["ply"],
		returns: [""],
	}
]} />

## Network "Builder" Methods
The network builder is used on the client for the network queue to work correctly. This has no extra special features on the serverside and just exists to make the client networking and server networking similar.
These network messages can be received the same way as normal net messages.

### Example
```lua
PulsarStore.Net.Start("ExampleNetMessage")
	:WriteBool(true)
	:WriteInt(123, 32)
	:WriteUInt(123, 32)
	:WriteString("Hello World")
:Send()
```
