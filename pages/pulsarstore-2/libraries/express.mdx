# Express Library
This is basically just a wrapper for [gm_express](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express)<br/>
Even though its called `Express` it don't mean its fast. In fact, it's slower than the normal net library and is only used as a way of sending mass amounts of data without causing issues with the net library.
