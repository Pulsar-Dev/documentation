# Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to install three things into your `garrysmod/addons` folder.
1. PulsarStore
2. PIXEL UI
3. gm_express

The folder structure should look like this:
<FileTree>
	<FileTree.Folder name="garrysmod" defaultOpen>
		<FileTree.Folder name="addons" defaultOpen>
			<FileTree.Folder name="pulsar-lib" defaultOpen>
				<FileTree.Folder name="..." defaultOpen>
				</FileTree.Folder>
				<FileTree.File name="README.md" />
			</FileTree.Folder>
			<FileTree.Folder name="pulsar-store-2" defaultOpen>
				<FileTree.Folder name="..." defaultOpen>
				</FileTree.Folder>
				<FileTree.File name="README.md" />
			</FileTree.Folder>
		</FileTree.Folder>
	</FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>


<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
	The addon folder name must not contain capital letters on **Linux** servers and will fail to load if it does.
</Callout>

# Installing
To install the addons, simply drag and drop the folders into your `garrysmod/addons` folder.

## PulsarStore
1. Download the latest version of PulsarStore from the [releases page](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/pulsar-a-simple-ingame-store/versions)
2. Extract the contents of the zip file into your `garrysmod/addons` folder.
3. Ensure the addon name does not contain capital letters.

## PulsarLib
1. Download the latest version of PulsarLib from the [releases page](https://github.com/Pulsar-Dev/pixel-ui/releases/tag/1.3.2) if it has not come in the zip from gmodstore.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file into your `garrysmod/addons` folder.
3. Ensure the addon name does not contain capital letters.

## [gm_express](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express)
gm_express is **REQUIRED** for PulsarStore to work and is bundled inside PulsarLib so you do not need to install it yourself.<br/>

### What is [gm_express](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express) and why is it used?
[**gm_express**](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express) is a library
that allows you to send lots of data over the network without having to worry about the size limit.
This means that we can send large amounts of your PulsarStore data even if you have thousands of items in a couple of seconds.<br/>
[**gm_express**](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express) uses the HTTP library to achieve this,
meaning that the data has to be sent to an HTTP server.
No private, personal or sensitive data is ever sent to the HTTP server, only public data that is required for PulsarStore to work.<br/>
If you **do not** want to use gm_express' own web server kindly provided free of charge by [**CFC-Servers**](https://github.com/CFC-Servers) you can either [use your own](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express_service) or use the PulsarDevelopment teams' web server.<br/>
If you need assistance or have any questions regarding gm_express, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2ZQv7dVmtJ) and ask.
