## What's New?

### PulsarLib 1.1.0
PulsarLib has been updated to version 1.1.0 which includes a few new features and bug fixes. The new features and fixes include:
- New Module loading system - This allows for modules to be automatically loaded and updated without much hassle.
- New libraries/helpers ported from Pulsar Store.
	- Languages System
	- Functional library
	- Network Helper

- And more!

### PulsarUI 2.2.0
PulsarUI has been updated to version 2.2.0 which includes a few element reworks and bug fixes.
- Reworked Text Entries to look better
- Reworked the step counter to look less square and weird
- Added `pulsar_ui_font_resize` convar to allow resizing of fonts (default is 1.0)
- Old convars renamed to have `pulsar_ui_` prefix instead of `pixel_ui`

### Updatr 1.0.0
Pulsar Store has removed all usage of the gm_express library and has switched to using our own library called Updatr. \
Updatr is a library that allows for easy updating and networking of large tables of data between the client and server by only sending the differences between the old and new table. \
This means that we no longer have to send the entire table every time we want to update it, which reduces the time it takes to update and create data within Pulsar Store.

<Admonition type="warning">
	Updatr is currently very new and may have bugs. If you find any bugs, please report them in the [Pulsar Discord](https://discord.gg/WjdWPeePBE) or in the [Updatr GitHub repository](https://github.com/Pulsar-Dev/updatr).
