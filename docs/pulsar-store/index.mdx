import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';

## Getting Started

To get started, youâ€™ll need two things into your `garrysmod/addons` folder.
- Pulsar Store
- Pulsar-Lib

<Admonition type="warning">
  It is important to ensure that the addon folder names do not contain any spaces or special characters. This can cause issues with the addon loading.
</Admonition>

### Installing
To install the addons, simply drag and drop the folders into your `garrysmod/addons` folder.

#### Pulsar Store
1. Download the latest version of PulsarStore from the release page
2. Extract the contents of the zip file into your garrysmod/addons folder.
3. Ensure the addon name does not contain capital letters.

#### Pulsar-Lib
1. Download the latest version of Pulsar-Lib from the release page
2. if it has not come in the zip from gmodstore.
3. Extract the contents of the zip file into your garrysmod/addons folder.

### Configuration
Pulsar Store's configuration is mostly in-game, but there are some things that you need to configure in the files. This page will go over the configuration files and how to configure them.

#### MySQL
MySQL is not required for Pulsar Store, but it is recommended. MySQL can be used for storing data in an external database,
which is useful for servers with multiple servers. If you don't know how to set up a MySQL server,
you can find a tutorial [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04), or you can use one provided by your host.

#### MySQL Configuration
The MySQL configuration file can be found at the following location: `garrysmod/data/pulsarlib/mysql.json`. \
If this file does not exist, you can create it yourself or restart your server to generate it. \
The configuration file is pretty self-explanatory, but if you need help, you can find it below:
```json
{
	"UsingMySQL": false,
	"Password": "",
	"Database": "",
	"Username": "",
	"Hostname": "",
	"Port": 3306
}
```

#### Currencies
Currencies are the different types of currency that you can use in Pulsar Store. You can have as many currencies as you want,
but you need at least one. The default currency is 'Pulsar Credits'.

<Admonition type="warning">
	Removing the default currency is **NOT** recommended, as it is used for a lot of things. \
	The addon may not function correctly if you remove the default currency. \
	**No support will be given if you remove the default currency.**
</Admonition>

More information can be found [here](./store-currencies).

#### Languages
The language used by Pulsar Store and any other addons that use Pulsar-Lib are set by the language picked by the player.
If you want to change the default language, you can do so by clicking the language icon in the bottom right of the escape menu.

If you would like to create a new language or modify an existing one, you can do so by making a pull request on the [Pulsar-Lib GitHub](https://github.com/Pulsar-Dev/store-2-languages).
