Actions are functions that are run once a package is purchased or ran. Actions are fairly easy to create and can do anything you would like.

<Admonition type="tip">
	All actions are ran and created serverside. No actions are created, ran or handled clientside. Everything that the client needs about actions will get sent when needed.
</Admonition>

## Creating an Action

To create an action, you first need to register it using the **ActionHandler**. This can be done by using the `PulsarStore.Actions.Create` function.

### Example
```lua
PulsarStore.Actions.Create("ExampleAction")
    :OnPurchase(function(ply, argument)
        if not IsValid(ply) then
            print("Player dont exist!")
            return
        end

        print("Player " .. ply:Nick() .. " purchased this package!")
    end)
    :OnPrePurchase(function(ply, argument)
        if not ply:Alive() then
            return {
                canContinue = false,
                message = "You need to be alive to purchase this package!"
            }
        end

        return {
            canContinue = true,
            message = ""
        }
    end)
    :ArgumentTitle("Example Argument")
    :ArgumentExample("example")
    :CanReturn(true)
    :CanPermanent(true)
:Done()
```
