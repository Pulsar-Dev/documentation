In some actions you can use string replacements. These are special strings that will be replaced with a value when the action is executed. \
The following string replacements are available:
- `{sid} `- The players SteamID
- `{sid64}` - The players SteamID64
- `{name}` - The players name
- `{nickname}` - The players nickname

If you need more string replacements please create a ticket on gmodstore.
